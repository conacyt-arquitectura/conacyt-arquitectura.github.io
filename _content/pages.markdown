A page is the most basic content type in Siteleaf. Pages are free-floating and belong to your site, rather than any particular collection.

Any page with a markdown extension (e.g. `about.markdown`) and front matter will show up under the Pages section in Siteleaf.
{: .note}

### Options

##### Path

Changing the path changes the location of the generated Markdown file and the path the page is accessible at on your site.

##### Visibility

By default, pages are visible. You can change this by switching it to hidden.

##### Date

This changes the timestamp associated with the page.

##### Permalink

The permalink also changes the path the page is accessible at on your site.

##### Layout

Choose which layout you'd like to use. Any layout you have in `_layouts` will be listed here.
