If your site needs to support multiple languages, you have several solutions available:

**1)** Create multiple versions of your pages (in each language). For example:

`/en/about.markdown -> /en/about/`
`/fr/about.markdown -> /fr/about/`

**2)** Use JavaScript and perform translations client-side ([as pointed out here](https://gist.github.com/sskylar/8524524)).

**3)** Use a [Jekyll plugin](/themes/jekyll-plugins/) like [jekyll-multiple-languages-plugin](https://github.com/Anthony-Gaudino/jekyll-multiple-languages-plugin). Note: Custom Jekyll plugins are only supported on Team, Business, and Enterprise Siteleaf plans.
