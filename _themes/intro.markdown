If you haven't yet, give [Siteleaf for Developers](/getting-started/siteleaf-for-developers/) a quick read.

To create a theme for your Siteleaf site, you'll need to know HTML and [Liquid](/themes/liquid/). To set up your local environment, check out our [local development guide](/themes/local-development/).

Once you're up and running, [GitHub Sync](/themes/github-sync/) makes it incredibly simple to ensure your GitHub repository and Siteleaf site have the same content and theme.

A great resource for theme creation is [Jekyll's documentation](http://jekyllrb.com/docs): they go into depth with how different content types work and what Liquid tags and objects you have available for making your themes.
